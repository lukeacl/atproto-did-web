# atproto-did-web

## Introduction

This tool has been designed to assist in the creation of a did:web based account on
a self hosted PDS. All operations are performed client side on your device, with only
necessary outgoing network calls made to your web server to validate did.json files,
and to the PDS to create and activate your account. No private data you provide is
stored or shared. If you refresh this page it will reset the process.
